## effects
1. Image data augmentation, including but not limited to: image rotation, scale enhancement, Gaussian noise, saturation variation, etc.
2. If the image contains corresponding annotated bounding boxes, corresponding transformations are also supported to ensure the invariance of the selected content.
3. Implement multiple methods of random combinations to enhance the augmentation effect.
